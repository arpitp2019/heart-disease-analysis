This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

Columns are - 
age

sex

cp: chest pain type
-- Value 1: typical angina
-- Value 2: atypical angina
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain
-- Value 4: asymptomatic

trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation ordepression    of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-- Value 1: upsloping
-- Value 2: flat
-- Value 3: downsloping

ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 1= normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
